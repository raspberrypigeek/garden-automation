<h3>Introduction</h3>
The aim of this repo is to provide a simple platform for watering the garden.

<h3>Geting Started</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat">Automation Hat</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Deployment</h4>
If you want to use this project, you need to install the following: 
    git clone https://github.com/raspberrypigeek/garden-automation.git
    cd server/bin



<h3>Architecture</h3>
So the initial assumption is that I want to build something that can run on a single Raspberry Pi but if desired be deployed across multiple Raspberry Pis.
